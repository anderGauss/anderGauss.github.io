        <h2>Me!</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Andre, I like to do programming and meth I mean math!!! I'm currently 15 and I'm pretty sure I'll keep getting older.
            I live in the state of California, in the USA. To kill time whenever I'm bored, I like to play video games, but only when I've got time.
            Most of the day will be spent on schoolwork or studying for other outside classes. 
        </p>
        <p>I also have a dog named Hachi</p>

            They say that if you fail, try and try again. With that being said, welcome to my Tedtalk on the benefits of a gambling addiction.
            What is an addiction anyways? Who gets to decide what it means to be addicted? The so-called "medical professionals"??? Sounds like a
            CIA psyops to me pal. People should honestly be more addicted to things, especially gambling! It helps the economy since you are directly
            feeding money into these small businesses, letting them grow and expand their business. With that being said, go out there and get gambling!
            Go all in with your life savings when you've got a trash hand in a game of Texas Hold 'em. What's the worst that could happen?

            People should honestly eat more soap. It's very nutritious I would assume. It cleans your skin doesn't it? With that information, wouldn't it be
            reasonable to assume that it could also clean the inside of your esophagus? Don't believe the government lies of "oooohhh it's bad for you it 
            could poison you oooohhh"; when did you ever try to actually eat soap? Never? That's what I thought, so do your part and eat some soap, and save
            a life.
